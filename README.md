# Stellar spectroscopy

The purpose of this document is writing a lab report for the observational astrophysics part of the lab 3 subject at University of Alicante. In this case we want to study three stars from the data obtained from a telescope. We'll be using the Starlink suite for this job, although its files won't be included in the repository. It includes:

- A [Latex](Latex) folder, in which the files for generating the lab report using PdFLaTeX are included.
- A [Python](Python) folder, in which there's some code used for the analysis of some data.
